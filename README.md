# My Personal Website / Portfolio

This website showcases select frontend projects that I have undertaken and 
also is a project in itself. The site does not rely heavily on JavaScript
for interactivity in order to demonstrate that I can achieve these effects 
using only HTML and CSS. Heavier use of JavaScript can be found in the site's
project section. 

## Technologies Utilized

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Transitions, Transforms)
- SASS / SCSS
- Gulp.js

## Methodologies

- BEM naming convention
- Web Components
- SASS structure based off [7-1 Pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern)
- Semantic HTML
- Responsive Web Design
